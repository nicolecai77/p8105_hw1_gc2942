# Problem 1

The chunk below creates a dataframe containing a random sample of size
10 from a standard Normal distribution, construct a logical vector,
takes a character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10,
with 3 different factor “levels”(“Good”,“Very Good”,“Excellent”).

``` r
hw_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  gr_than_0 = sample > 0,
  vec_char = c("I","will","go","to","Mailman","School","of","Public","School", "tommorrow"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Good","Very Good","Excellent","Good","Very Good","Excellent","Good","Very Good","Excellent","Good"))
)
 mean(pull(hw_df, sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.08756142

``` r
 mean(pull(hw_df, gr_than_0)) 
```

    ## [1] 0.6

I can take the mean of sample from standard normal distribution and a
logical vector, but I fail to run the mean for a character vector and a
factor vector.Therefore, I write the following code and try to convert
those variables from one type to numeric.

``` r
  as.numeric((pull(hw_df, gr_than_0)) 
  as.numeric(pull(hw_df,vec_char))
  as.numeric(pull(hw_df,vec_factor))
```

The result shows that it is impossible to convert a character vector
into a numerical number. However, we can assign the number to an ordinal
variable.

## Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

We first download the penguins data set. There are 344 and 8 within the
data set. Variables are included species, island, bill\_length\_mm,
bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year. The mean
flipper length is 200.9152047.

Then we make the scatterplot for penguins.

``` r
ggplot(penguins,aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
        y = flipper_length_mm,
        color =  species)) + geom_point() 
```
